What is object-oriented programming?,Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields, and the code is in the form of procedures, often known as methods. Key principles are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
Explain the difference between a compiler and an interpreter.,A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code before execution, creating an executable file. An interpreter translates and executes the code line-by-line at runtime. Compiled languages often run faster, while interpreted languages can be more flexible.
How does a for loop work?,"A for loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration. It typically has an initializing statement, a condition, and an increment/decrement. For example, in Python: `for i in range(5): print(i)` will print numbers 0 through 4."
Why do we use version control systems like Git?,Git helps track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work together, maintain a history of changes, revert to previous stages, and manage different versions of a project (e.g., features, releases) through branching.
What is a recursive function?,"A recursive function is a function that calls itself in its definition. It must have a base case (a condition to stop) and a recursive case (where it calls itself with modified parameters). For example, calculating a factorial: `n! = n * (n-1)!`."
My code has an 'IndexError: list index out of range'. What does this mean?,This error means you are trying to access an element at an index that does not exist in the list. Remember, list indices start at 0. If a list has 3 items, the valid indices are 0, 1, and 2. Trying to access index 3 will cause this error.
What is the difference between '==' and 'is' in Python?,"`==` is a value equality operator. It checks if two objects have the same value. `is` is an identity operator. It checks if two variables point to the exact same object in memory. Use `==` for comparing values, and `is` for checking if two references are to the same object (like `x is None`)."
How do I connect to a database using Python?,"You typically use a library like `sqlite3` (for SQLite) or `mysql-connector-python` (for MySQL). The general steps are: 1. Import the library. 2. Establish a connection object. 3. Create a cursor object. 4. Execute SQL queries using the cursor. 5. Commit changes if needed. 6. Close the connection."
What is an API?,API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. A common example is a web API, where your program sends an HTTP request to a server and receives data back (often in JSON format).
Explain the concept of Big O notation.,Big O notation describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It expresses the worst-case scenario of how long an algorithm takes to run (time complexity) or how much memory it uses (space complexity) relative to the input size. For example, O(1) is constant time, O(n) is linear time.
What is the stack and the heap?,"The stack and heap are areas of memory used by programs. The stack is used for static memory allocation and stores local variables and function call information. It's very fast but limited in size. The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation (e.g., `new` in Java, `malloc` in C). It's larger but slower to allocate and must be manually managed (or handled by a garbage collector)."
How does public-key cryptography work?,"Public-key cryptography uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt data, and the corresponding private key is used to decrypt it. This allows secure communication without needing to share a secret key beforehand. It's the foundation of HTTPS and SSH."
What is the difference between a process and a thread?,"A process is an instance of a running program with its own memory space. A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process; threads of the same process share memory and resources. Multithreading can make programs more efficient but introduces challenges like race conditions."
What is SQL injection and how can I prevent it?,SQL injection is a code injection technique where an attacker can execute malicious SQL statements that control a web application's database. Prevent it by never constructing queries with string concatenation from user input. Instead, use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by your database library.
Explain the MVC architecture.,MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It's a design pattern for separating concerns in an application. The Model represents the data and business logic. The View is the user interface and presentation layer. The Controller handles user input, interacts with the Model, and selects the View to display.
What is a neural network?,"A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics how the human brain operates. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer."
How do I choose between a list and a tuple in Python?,Use a list for collections of items that are meant to be changed (mutable). Use a tuple for collections of items that are meant to be constant and unchanging (immutable). Tuples are also faster than lists and can be used as keys in dictionaries.
What is a Docker container?,"A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, ensuring consistency across environments."
Why do we need to learn data structures?,"Data structures are fundamental to organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently. Choosing the right data structure (e.g., array, linked list, hash table, tree) can drastically improve the performance and scalability of your algorithms and applications."
What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?,HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) sends data in plain text, which is insecure. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure the communication between a client and a server. This prevents eavesdropping and tampering with the data.
My program is running very slowly. How can I profile it to find the bottleneck?,"You can use profiling tools. In Python, use the `cProfile` module. In Java, use VisualVM or Java Flight Recorder. These tools show you which functions or methods are taking the most time (CPU) or allocating the most memory, helping you identify the bottleneck."
What is a promise in JavaScript?,"A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more manageable way, avoiding 'callback hell'. You use `.then()` for success and `.catch()` for errors."
Explain the concept of 'state' in React.,In React, state is a built-in object that contains data or information about the component. A component's state can change over time, usually in response to user actions. When the state changes, the component re-renders, updating the UI to reflect the new state.
What is the difference between a primary key and a foreign key in a database?,"A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table (e.g., a user ID). A foreign key is a field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It establishes a link between the two tables, creating a relationship."
How does a binary search tree work?,"A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children. For any node, all values in its left subtree are less than the node's value, and all values in its right subtree are greater. This allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion (average time O(log n))."
What is the purpose of an index in a database?,A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It works much like an index in a book, allowing the database to find data without having to scan every row in the table. The trade-off is that indexes slow down data write operations (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
What is the difference between a GET and a POST request?,"GET requests are used to retrieve data from a server. Parameters are sent in the URL query string. POST requests are used to send data to the server to create/update a resource. The data is sent in the body of the request, making it more secure for sensitive information than GET."
Explain what a RESTful API is.,REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A RESTful API uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data. It treats server objects as resources that can be created, read, updated, or deleted.
What is machine learning?,"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves."
How do I reverse a linked list?,"To reverse a singly linked list, you need to iterate through the list and reverse the pointers. You'll need three pointers: previous, current, and next. Initialize previous to NULL. For each node, store the next node, point the current node's pointer to previous, then move previous and current one step forward."
What is a virtual machine (VM)?,A Virtual Machine is an emulation of a computer system. It runs on a physical host machine but is isolated from it. It provides its own virtual hardware (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) and can run its own operating system and applications. Examples include VirtualBox and VMware.
What is the difference between authentication and authorization?,"Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is (e.g., logging in with a username and password). Authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to (e.g., determining if the logged-in user has permission to delete a specific file)."
What is a closure in JavaScript?,"A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer function's scope, and the global scope—even after the outer function has finished executing. It 'remembers' the environment in which it was created. This is a powerful feature for data privacy and creating function factories."
Explain the concept of 'garbage collection'.,Garbage collection is the automatic process of reclaiming memory that is no longer in use by the program. The garbage collector finds objects that are not referenced by any part of the program and deletes them, freeing up memory. Languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript have automatic garbage collection.
What is the command line, and why should I use it?,"The command line (or terminal/shell) is a text-based interface to interact with your computer's operating system. It allows for powerful, fast, and automatable tasks that are often more efficient or simply not possible through a graphical user interface (GUI)."
How do I merge two branches in Git?,"You use the `git merge` command. First, check out the branch you want to merge INTO (e.g., `git checkout main`). Then, run `git merge feature-branch`. This will combine the changes from 'feature-branch' into 'main'. If there are conflicts, you will need to resolve them manually."
What is the difference between a stack and a queue?,"A stack is a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure. The last element added is the first one to be removed (like a stack of plates). A queue is a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure. The first element added is the first one to be removed (like a line of people)."
What is an IP address?,"An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the host in the network."
How does a hash table work?,"A hash table stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index (hash code) into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function assigns each key to a unique bucket, enabling average O(1) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions."
What is the purpose of the 'finally' block in a try-catch?,"The `finally` block in a try-catch statement executes after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. It's used to execute cleanup code, like closing files or database connections, ensuring that crucial cleanup always happens."
Explain the concept of 'responsive web design'.,Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. It uses flexible layouts, flexible images, and CSS media queries to adapt the layout to the viewing environment.
What is a pointer?,"A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Instead of holding a value directly, it 'points' to the location where the value is stored. Pointers are powerful but can be complex, as they are used for dynamic memory allocation, arrays, and passing by reference."
How do I find the time complexity of my algorithm?,"To find time complexity, analyze how the number of operations grows as the input size (n) grows. Ignore constants and lower-order terms. Common complexities are O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), O(2^n). Count loops and recursive calls to determine the growth rate."
What is the DOM?,"The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page as a tree of nodes and objects, allowing programming languages (like JavaScript) to manipulate the document's structure, style, and content dynamically."
What is the difference between a class and an object?,"A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. An object is an instance of a class—a concrete entity based on that blueprint. For example, 'Car' is a class, and your specific red car is an object of that class."
What is an algorithm?,"An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer. It's a well-defined sequence of instructions that takes a set of inputs and produces a desired output."
How does the internet work?,"The internet is a global network of computers that communicate using standardized protocols (like TCP/IP). Data is broken into packets, which are routed from the source to the destination through a series of routers. Protocols like HTTP, DNS, and SSL/TLS work on top of this to enable web browsing and other services."
What is the difference between a linked list and an array?,"An array is a contiguous block of memory with a fixed size, allowing fast O(1) access to elements by index. A linked list is a collection of nodes, where each node points to the next one. It has dynamic size and allows efficient O(1) insertions/deletions at the head, but accessing an element requires O(n) traversal."
What is a shell?,A shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for accessing an operating system's services. It takes commands from the user, interprets them, and executes the corresponding programs. Common shells include Bash on Linux/macOS and PowerShell on Windows.
What is a race condition?,"A race condition occurs in multithreaded programming when the behavior of the software depends on the relative timing of events, such as the order in which threads are scheduled. It happens when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time, leading to unpredictable results."
How do I write a good unit test?,"A good unit test should be: 1. Isolated: It tests one specific piece of functionality. 2. Repeatable: It produces the same results every time. 3. Fast: It runs quickly. 4. Clear: Its purpose and pass/fail criteria are obvious. Use a testing framework (like JUnit, pytest) and follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern."
What is the difference between a function and a method?,"A function is a block of code that is defined outside of a class and is called by its name. A method is a function that is associated with an object or a class and is defined inside a class. It is called on an instance of that class (or on the class itself for static methods)."
What is a kernel?,"The kernel is the core part of an operating system. It is the bridge between software and hardware. Its main responsibilities include managing the system's resources (CPU, memory, devices) and providing a way for software to request services from the hardware (system calls)."
What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?,"A `while` loop checks the condition first, and if it's true, the code inside the loop executes. A `do-while` loop executes the code inside the loop once first, and then checks the condition. This guarantees that the code inside a `do-while` loop runs at least once."
What is a design pattern?,"A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is a template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Examples include Singleton, Observer, and Factory."
How do I secure a web application?,"Web application security involves multiple layers: 1. Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent injection attacks. 2. Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. 3. Implement strong authentication and authorization. 4. Keep all software and dependencies up to date. 5. Use security headers (like CSP). 6. Store passwords securely (hashed and salted)."
What is the difference between a struct and a class in C++?,In C++, the only default difference is the access level: members of a `struct` are public by default, while members of a `class` are private by default. Otherwise, they are functionally equivalent in terms of what they can contain (methods, inheritance, etc.).
What is a lambda function?,"A lambda function (or anonymous function) is a small, unnamed function defined inline. It is often used for short, throwaway functions where defining a full function using `def` or `function` would be cumbersome. For example, in Python: `lambda x: x * 2` doubles its input."
What is the difference between black-box testing and white-box testing?,"Black-box testing treats the software as a 'black box'—testers examine functionality without knowing the internal code
